\section{Conclusion}
Having understood the subject, its issues and constraints, having created supports to use the sensors and having started to collect our first accelerometric data, we can move on to the next stage of the project. Between now and the next review, we plan to analyze the data collected. This will give us an idea of the artificial intelligence model to use. Once this is done, we will have to collect more data so that the selected models are trainable and as accurate as possible. We will then be able to compare the models and choose which one(s) we will select for the rest of the project. Finally, we will also start to develop the mobile application because it can be done in parallel with the artificial intelligence part.
