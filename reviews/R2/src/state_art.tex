\section{State of the Art}
Artificial intelligence is being used more and more and is becoming more and more powerful. Current AI models are capable of responding to complex tasks with solid repercussions. The applications are diverse: audio signal processing, medical image classification, or defect detection on production lines.\\
There are already many applications regarding roads notably: drunk driving detection \cite{drunk_2}\cite{drunk_1} or vehicles control and monitoring \cite{xxii} without forgetting autonomous vehicles which do not cease evolving \cite{vehicle_1}.\\
Road condition analysis and damage detection have been the subject of much research. Some researchers use external accelerometers in a series of ﬁlters to identify potholes or railway crossings via time-domain analysis only \cite{road_4}\cite{road_5}. Data are generally used in the frequency domain \cite{road_2}\cite{road_1}.\\
The use of smartphone accelerometric sensors has already proven to be a relevant alternative to external sensors \cite{road_3}. Systems that performs rich sensing using smartphones used by people on regular day-to-day driving, where several sensing modalities, such as accelerometers, microphones, GSM radio and GPS are used to monitor both road and trafﬁc conditions \cite{road_6}.\\
Other machine learning applications use accelerometric data. The rise of connected watches has revealed the usefulness of this data type for fall detection \cite{fall_1} \cite{fall_2} using edge artificial intelligence architecture \cite{fall_3}.\\

% The analysis of road quality measured by longitudinal has been studied for road and aeronautical pavements \cite{road_7}.
