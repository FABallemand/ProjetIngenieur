\section{Conclusion}

Our endeavor to develop AI solutions for road damage detection has led to valuable insights and achievements. We explored two primary AI methodologies: the sliding window approach and segmentation-based CNNs.

While the sliding window approach showed promise for smaller sequences, it posed limitations in processing longer data sequences.

The segmentation-based CNN model, designed to handle multi-class classification, encountered challenges related to overfitting. However, the model showcased potential for segmenting sequences and assigning multiple classes.

Our future focus involves refining the segmentation model, addressing overfitting challenges, and optimizing our approach to handle longer sequences. This pursuit aims to enhance the accuracy of road damage detection and streamline road quality assessment.

Simultaneously, our mobile application proved to be a milestone, facilitating direct data storage in Google Drive, streamlining data collection and integration with analysis tools.\\

In conclusion, our commitment to ongoing research and model refinement remains steadfast. Our aim is to contribute to safer road infrastructures and more efficient road quality assessment through innovative AI solutions and an effective mobile application.
