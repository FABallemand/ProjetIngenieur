Certainly, here is a summarized version:

"Our engineering project began with in-depth research into road quality assessment methods. It was organized around data collection, AI model creation, and Android application development. Initial data collection involved Arduino-based recordings, while simultaneous Android app development improved precise data gathering. Refining the dataset through manual labeling was crucial for effective AI model training.

The project then progressed to exploring sequence classification approaches like LSTM, CNN, and anomaly detection. Following a team reorganization, the project's timeline was adjusted. A preliminary analysis of the data collected via a mobile application provided valuable insights.

This dataset creation involved recording raw data in text files with specific labels, and a data augmentation process was initiated to enrich the dataset. The CNN model implementation showed promising performance with 93\% accuracy and a 17\% loss, marking a significant milestone in our classification goal."
